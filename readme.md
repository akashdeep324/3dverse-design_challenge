Here are different ways of launching the code available on the given GitHub repository:

Using Visual Studio Code Online:

First, visit VS Code Online (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
Click on "Continue with GitHub" and log in with your GitHub account.
Once logged in, you'll be in an environment that looks like VS Code. Click on "Clone Repository" and paste the GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/akashdeep324/3dverse-design_challenge).
The repository will be cloned into the online editor. Now, you can work on your code online.



Using CodeSandbox Online Server:

Visit CodeSandbox.
Click "Create Sandbox" at the bottom right.
Select "Import Project".
In the "Import From GitHub" tab, paste the GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/akashdeep324/3dverse-design_challenge) and click "Import and Fork".
CodeSandbox will then create a new Sandbox where you can work with your code and run it as well.

Using Offline Node.js Server Using Command Prompt:

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. (https://nodejs.org/en).
Open command prompt and use cd to navigate to the folder where you want to clone the GitHub repository.
Run the command git clone https://github.com/akashdeep324/3dverse-design_challenge. This will clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate into the cloned folder by using cd 3dverse-design_challenge.
If a package.json file exists, run npm install to install all the dependencies.
Now, you can run your Node.js application by using the node command followed by the entry point file (typically node app.js or node index.js, depending on your project setup).
Your code should now be running on a local Node.js server.
