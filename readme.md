Here's how you can push or launch your code onto GitHub using the different methods you mentioned.

Using Visual Studio Code:

First, you need to install the Git version control system on your machine.
Then, open the folder containing your project in Visual Studio Code.
Go to the source control panel (the icon that looks like a branching graph), stage your changes, commit your code with a message.
Finally, push your changes using the "..." menu at the top of the Source Control view and selecting "Push".
If your repository isn't already connected to a remote one on GitHub, you can add it using the command "Git: Add Remote" in the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
Using an online Sandbox server:

Online development environments like CodeSandbox and Repl.it have built-in support for pushing to GitHub.
Once you've created a new project, you can create a new GitHub repository directly from the Sandbox.
After making changes to your code, you can commit and push the changes to GitHub directly from the Sandbox interface.
Using an offline Node.js server with Command Prompt:

First, navigate to your project folder using the command prompt.
Initialize a new Git repository with the command git init.
Stage your changes using git add . for all changes or git add <filename> for specific files.
Commit your changes with git commit -m "commit message".
If you haven't already, add your remote GitHub repository with git remote add origin <repository_url>.
Finally, push your changes to GitHub with git push origin master (or replace 'master' with the name of your current branch if different).
Remember that you should replace "<repository_url>" with the actual URL of your GitHub repository, and "commit message" with a description of the changes you've made.
